    "# Elasticsearch and VectorDB tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to introduce the basic concepts of **Elasticsearch** as well as direct applications using **VectorDB**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elasticsearch is an open-source project that you can install locally on your own machines. This has the advantage of not requiring an internet connection and keeping your data in an environment you control.  \n",
    "However, it is often more cost-effective to use a service provided by Elasticsearch to host such a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, two options are available to run Elasticsearch and a data-visualization dashboard (Kibana):\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Option 1 (recommended)**: launch an Elasticsearch cluster with Kibana locally using the `.env` and `docker-compose.yml` files:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cd [this folder]\n",
    "docker compose up\n",
    "```\n",
    "(see if needed : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Option 2**: use the Elasticsearch serverless trial version, which allows you to quickly get an Elasticsearch database connected to Kibana.\n",
    "To do this, simply go to https://cloud.elastic.co/registration\n",
    " and create an account. Once your account is created, you can create a deployment, which will give you an endpoint (e.g. https://10468406azdad...:443) as well as an API key.\n"
