    "\n",
    "We can combine BM25 with filters and custom scoring functions to create more sophisticated ranking strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding Function Score\n",
    "\n",
    "The `function_score` query allows you to modify the relevance score of documents returned by a query. This is incredibly powerful for:\n",
    "- **Boosting popular content**: Increase scores for documents with high view counts, ratings, etc.\n",
    "- **Time-based ranking**: Boost recent content or decay older content\n",
    "- **Business logic**: Apply custom scoring based on any field value\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Query**: The BM25 query that finds matching documents\n",
    "2. **Filters**: Restrict results to specific criteria (faster than queries, cached)\n",
    "3. **Functions**: Mathematical transformations applied to field values\n",
    "4. **Boost Mode**: How to combine function scores with query scores\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function Score Parameters Explained:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`factor`**: Multiplier applied to the field value (e.g., 0.001 means divide by 1000)\n",
    "- **`modifier`**: Mathematical function to apply\n",
    "- **`boost_mode`**: How to combine function score with query score (sum, avg, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use Filters vs Queries?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filters** are faster because they:\n",
    "  - Don't calculate relevance scores\n",
    "  - Are cached automatically\n",
    "  - Use bit sets for efficient matching\n",
    "  - Perfect for exact matches (categories, tags, dates, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Queries** calculate relevance scores and are better for:\n",
    "  - Text matching\n",
    "  - Fuzzy matching\n",
    "  - When you need scoring\n",

    "\n",
    "### When to Use Each Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **BM25 (Text Search)**\n",
    "   - ✅ Exact keyword matching is important\n",
    "   - ✅ You need to handle rare terms well\n",
    "   - ✅ Working with structured text data\n",
    "   - ✅ Fast, no embedding generation needed\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vector Search (Semantic Search)**\n",
    "   - ✅ Semantic similarity is more important than exact matches\n",
    "   - ✅ Multilingual content\n",
    "   - ✅ Finding conceptually similar content\n",
    "   - ✅ Working with embeddings from pre-trained models\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hybrid Search**\n",
    "   - ✅ **Best for most production use cases**\n",
    "   - ✅ Need both keyword and semantic matching\n",
    "   - ✅ Want to maximize recall and precision\n",
    "   - ✅ Have resources for both text and vector indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Index size**: Vector indices are larger than text indices\n",
    "- **Query latency**: Hybrid search is slower but more accurate\n",
    "- **Embedding generation**: Consider caching embeddings\n",
    "- **HNSW parameters**: Tune `m` and `ef_construction` based on your data size\n"

    "1. **BM25** is excellent for keyword matching and exact term retrieval\n",
    "2. **Vector search** excels at semantic understanding and finding similar concepts\n",
    "3. **Hybrid search** combines the best of both worlds and is recommended for production\n",
    "4. **Performance** can be optimized through proper index settings and query design\n",
    "5. **Real embedding models** should be used in production (not the demo function)"
